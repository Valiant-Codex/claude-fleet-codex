# Contributing

Thanks for looking under the hood. Claude Fleet Codex is a **blueprint + templates**, so contributions are
mostly docs, templates, and portability fixes rather than a running app.

## Ways to help

- **Report a gap or a broken step** — open an issue describing what you were doing (following
  `README_AGENT.md`? adapting a template?) and where it snagged.
- **Improve the docs** — clarity fixes, missing prerequisites, better diagrams.
- **Harden the templates** — safer/cleaner scripts, more portable systemd units.
- **Port the happy path** — notes or adapters for other agent runtimes or other Linux distros.

## Ground rules

1. **Never commit a secret.** No tokens, keys, real hostnames, capability URLs (healthchecks ping URLs
   included), emails, or client data — in code, examples, or history. Examples use placeholders
   (`<ORG>`, `<AGENT>`, `<ROLE>`, `<VPS_HOST>`, `<TZ>`, `<HC_URL>`, `<OWNER>`) or obviously-fake values
   (`acme-labs`, `acme-ops-01`). The `.gitignore` files exist to protect you — don't loosen them.
2. **Templates stay generic.** Anything under `templates/` must be reusable by anyone: no brand names,
   no environment specifics. The named worked example lives only in `docs/reference-architecture.md`.
3. **Keep the security model intact.** The three-tier boundary (git / kb-sync / provision) in
   `docs/config-model.md` is load-bearing — changes that let the 15-minute auto-sync install
   executables or grant permissions defeat the point. Explain the reasoning in your PR.
4. **Match the voice.** Lean, direct, honest about limitations (see how the docs treat "lanes are not a
   sandbox"). Update the relevant folder `README.md` when you add or rename files.

## PRs

Small, focused PRs with a clear description are easiest to review. If you're changing the security or
config model, say so explicitly and describe the trade-off.

## Releases

This repo is a **starting example**, not a mirror of the deployment it came from — divergence is the
expected steady state. Two things flow upstream: **framework-level** change (the memory model, a new
mechanism, a new fleet-common skill, the brain shape, the config model) and **every safety or
correctness fix**, without exception. Shipping strangers root bash with a bug we already fixed for
ourselves is a liability, not a personalisation.

**The delta is derived, not remembered.** An earlier convention asked for an `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG
line to be written the moment a change was judged framework-level; in practice that step did not fire
(a full audit found a dozen unrecorded propagation-mandatory fixes). So the release process derives
the delta mechanically instead:

1. **Diff `templates/` against the reference implementation** (the private `infra/` and
   `kb-agent-shared/` it was distilled from — `diff -rq` per tree, then the hunks) and account for
   every hunk: port it (generalized, placeholders per ground rule 2), or consciously leave it private
   (deployment-specific). The diff cannot forget; a convention can. Files with no reference
   counterpart — the template `CLAUDE.md` and README, `bootstrap.md`, the docs — are invisible to this
   step; the sweep below is what covers them.
2. Write the CHANGELOG section for the release **from that reconciled diff**:
   `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD — <headline>`. Pre-1.0, a batch of correctness/honesty fixes is a
   **minor**; a single scoped security/robustness fix is a **patch**. **Entries record, they do not
   explain**: what changed, in which files, and the one-line reason. The reasoning lives in the
   reference deployment's decision records; a CHANGELOG written as essays restates every mechanism
   and goes stale like any other copy (it was the largest document in this repo by 0.11.0).
3. Add the link definition at the bottom: `[X.Y.Z]: .../releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`.
4. Commit as `vX.Y.Z: <headline>`, then an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z` with subject
   `claude-fleet-codex vX.Y.Z — <headline>`.
5. Push commits **and** tags (`git push && git push --tags`), then publish the GitHub Release from the
   tag so the CHANGELOG's links resolve.

Before tagging, sanity-check the mechanical things that have actually been missed before: every version
has a link definition, every shipped shell script still passes `bash -n` (Python tools:
`python3 -m py_compile`), no `Valiant‑Codex`-specific name survives under `templates/` (grep for the
reference deployment's agent names and org), and `git status --ignored` shows no build artefact staged
(`git add -A` shipped a `.pyc` in 0.11.0).

Two more, and both are judgement, not mechanism — say so to yourself when you run them: **for every
claim this release changes or retires, search the whole repo for the fact, not one phrasing** (list
the synonyms the first hits suggest: "only file", "one file", "loads by itself", "always-on file",
"identity and voice" were the ones for the launch-loading fact, and 0.8.6's author did not conceive
"voice moves to output styles" as retiring "only file" at all); and **read the release's own diff
once for self-contradiction** — 0.11.0 stated a fact and its negation in one hunk of one file. Neither
step can be verified to have run. The structural protection is the one-place rule: a fact that lives
in one file and is pointed at from the others has nothing to sweep.
