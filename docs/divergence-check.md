<!-- title: Divergence check — invariants, not vocabulary -->
# The divergence check

Your brains are Markdown, so nothing stops them from quietly disagreeing with reality: a renamed file
leaves dangling references, a skill stops being discoverable, an adapter names a file that no longer
exists, a clone stops syncing. None of that raises an error — the agent just gets a little less correct
every week. `agentic-divergence-check` is a **read-only** daily linter for exactly that class of rot.

It **reports, it never fixes.** Fixes go through a human (or the `agent-audit` skill), because deciding
*what* the truth should be is judgement, not automation.

## What it checks

Per agent brain:

- **Declared shape** — `CLAUDE.md` exists and carries the sections whose absence is silent (the
  confirm gates, the untrusted-content rule, the autonomous-OK list); no `SOUL.md`/`OPERATING.md`
  survives from the pre-0.7.0 split. There is no byte budget (see the index read limit below).
- **Frontmatter is real metadata** — it parses as YAML, and every `type` is drawn from the closed
  nine-value vocabulary in `knowledge-governance-workflow`, everywhere except the two documented
  exemptions (`CLAUDE.md`, `memory/auto/**`). Fails *closed*: with PyYAML missing it reports that it
  could not validate rather than passing. Note what it does **not** do — it never checks `type`
  against a file's location, so "a `SKILL.md` is `type: skill`" is honour-system, not enforced.
- **Skills are discoverable** — folder-per-skill with a `SKILL.md`, frontmatter `name` matching the
  folder, non-empty `description`, and no flat `skills/*.md` left behind.
- **Runtime registration** — `~/.claude/skills` *is* a symlink, resolves, and points at this brain's
  `skills/`. (Absent or dangling is exactly when skills are invisible, so both are failures.)
- **Every symlink resolves** — catches a fleet-common skill renamed in the shared layer.
- **The live entry point** — `~/CLAUDE.md` resolves to the brain's root `CLAUDE.md`, and every file
  that bootstrap names exists.
- **Clone agrees with origin** — a failed fetch, a branch with **no upstream** (both used to read as
  "in sync" — a fail-open), anything unpushed (a silently failing push) and anything behind (a repo
  the sync has been skipping) are each reported distinctly.
- **The topic registry** — `deploy/topics.tsv` is tracked, matches HEAD (a dirty registry is the
  signature of a failed `claude-topic` commit), and agrees **both directions** with the systemd units
  actually enabled.
- **Per-agent installed artifacts** — `~/.claude/settings.json` (the permission allowlist) matches
  `deploy/claude-settings.json`; the topic unit matches its infra source; any other
  `deploy/*.service|*.timer` matches its installed copy — and, in reverse, **no enabled user unit
  exists that the brain does not declare** (a hand-crafted service living only on the box is exactly
  what a rebuild silently loses).
- **Linger + timers** — linger is on per agent, the host timers are enabled, and a
  `memory-mirror@<agent>.timer` is enabled for every **active** roster agent (a never-enabled instance
  never runs, so it never fails either — no failed-unit sweep can see it).

  **For a dormant agent the assertion inverts: its writer must be OFF, and an enabled one is drift.**
  A dormant agent keeps its Unix user, its clones and its roster entry — removing it from the roster
  would leave an unswept home nothing looks at — so dormancy is declared separately, in
  `fleet-dormant` (one Unix user per line, next to `fleet-agents`; `DORMANT_AGENTS` overrides it for a
  one-off run). Its brain repo is usually archived, so a nightly push would 403, fail the unit, and
  page you every night. `install-host-services --enable-writers` reads the same file and skips them,
  which is the point of having one: the two root-installed scripts used to contradict each other.

  The reference and bootstrap-path sweeps also bail out for a dormant brain — it is a frozen snapshot
  whose prose points at a world that moved on, and fixing paths in a repo nobody may write buys
  nothing. Everything before that point still applies, including that its `CLAUDE.md` must say it is
  dormant.
- **Dormant agents named as live actors** — a dormant agent may appear in active prose; it may not
  appear in the present tense. The names are derived from the roster and `fleet-dormant`, so nothing
  here needs maintaining when an agent is added or woken; `decisions/`, `memory/` and `archive/` are
  exempt, because a record that cannot name a dormant agent is useless. This is the shape to copy
  when you want a new assertion: **derive the expectation from a source that already exists**, never
  from a list a human keeps current.
- **Auto-memory index read limit** — the runtime loads only the first 200 lines or 25 KB of
  `MEMORY.md` at session start and silently drops the rest, so a memory past that point is already
  invisible to recall. That is the one always-on number with a loss attached, and the only one
  asserted: drift on breach, an `[info]` line past 80%. The constants are the vendor's, pinned in the
  script to the docs page and date they were read from. The full always-on total (`CLAUDE.md` +
  `@`-imports + index) still prints on every run, because the trend is the signal — but it is no
  longer asserted against a budget. A total budget was tried first (20 → 30 → 40 KB in three days):
  it derived from nothing, was raised whenever it stung, would have fired long before the real cliff,
  and told you to shorten the index, which is the one thing that loses memories. Growth is managed by
  a named step in `agent-audit`, with a human reading the diff — never by a threshold, and never in
  the session that happened to notice.
- **Installed host artifacts** — everything `install-host-services` installed still matches its repo
  source. The manifest is generated by the installer itself, so *everything installed is listed* —
  but that is one-directional, and it is worth being precise about what it does not prove. It does
  not prove *everything present is listed*: a file placed by hand, or left behind by an aborted
  install, is not in the manifest and so was invisible to a check that only iterates manifest rows.
  A second sweep now reports anything in `/usr/local/share/agentic` the manifest does not account
  for. And since the comparison always runs source-against-install, it catches "edited the repo,
  forgot to re-install" — not "installed from somewhere unreviewed", which is why the manifest's
  recorded source path is itself asserted to be a clone this checker audits.
- **References resolve** — every relative path referenced in active Markdown exists. Renames self-report.
- **Roster vs reality** — the declared fleet and the brains on disk agree, in both directions.

Below the structural checks sits a clearly-labeled **updates section** (pending OS security updates,
Dokploy releases) — deliberately vocabulary-bound, because there is no vocabulary-free way to ask "is
there an update".

## The design rule: invariants, not vocabulary

An earlier version also grepped for stale *technology words* (an old VCS command, an old session
multiplexer, a removed filename). That was a maintenance trap, and it is worth stating why so you don't
rebuild it:

- The list encodes today's stack. When you change tools, nobody prunes it.
- It then passes because it no longer matches anything — **false confidence, worse than no check.**
- It can flag *true* content: an agent's own memory of a past migration legitimately mentions the old
  tool, and the checker would demand you censor an accurate memory.
- And "this document describes the old way" is a semantic judgement — that belongs to a human review
  pass, not a grep.

So the file names its two classes honestly: **structural invariants** (the list above minus the
stack-bound items), which stay true regardless of technology and never need pruning — and
**current-stack assertions** (topics.tsv vs systemd, installed artifacts, linger, timers, the updates
section), which deliberately encode today's runtime and must be changed with it. The header of the
script says which is which, so whoever prunes it next knows what outlives what.

## Wiring it

```bash
agentic-divergence-check          # run it by hand; exits 0 clean, 1 on drift/updates
# install-host-services enables the daily timer for you — nothing is left opt-in.
```

Two deliberate choices: `SuccessExitStatus=1` in the unit, so **drift does not mark the unit failed**
(agentic-monitor pages on failed units, and a stale doc link must never wake anyone at 3am); instead
the check pings its own healthchecks.io check (`UPDATE_HC_URL` in `/etc/agentic-monitor.env`) daily,
**with the actual drift findings in the ping body** — the alert message answers "what broke" without a
journal trip. A real malfunction — any other non-zero exit — still fails the unit loudly. (An earlier
arrangement ran a separate weekly `agentic-update-check` digest; it was folded in, because a weekly
digest gave every finding up to seven days of silence.)

**Get it clean, then keep it clean.** A check that always reports something trains you to ignore it.
