# kb-agent-template — a single agent's brain

This is the **template for one AI agent's durable brain**. A root agent copies it to create each new
agent, producing a repo named `kb-agent-<ROLE>-<AGENT>` (e.g. `kb-agent-ops-<AGENT>`) under your GitHub
org, cloned on the box at `~/github/<ORG>/kb-agent-<ROLE>-<AGENT>/`.

The template is written for a **root-agent archetype** (a privileged infra/ops operator with sudo) as
the worked example, entirely with placeholders. Fill them in and the same shape works for any role.

## Placeholders to replace

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<ORG>` | Your GitHub org that owns the repos. |
| `<OWNER>` | The human owner the agent takes instructions from. |
| `<AGENT>` | This agent's short name (and its Unix user). |
| `<ROLE>` | Role slug — `ops`, `cos`, `dev`, … |
| `<VPS_HOST>` | Hostname of the box it runs on. |
| `<TZ>` | Timezone (e.g. `Europe/Rome`). |

## The portability pattern

The contract lives in `CLAUDE.md`, in Markdown, in the form Claude Code loads, written with absolute
`~/github/...` paths so it resolves from cwd = `~`. What loads at launch, and why there is no second
identity file, is stated once in `shared/templates/agent-template.md`, "What loads at launch". The brain
files are written for Claude Code and are not portable to another harness as they stand; the shape of
a brain-in-Git is. See docs/portability.md in the claude-fleet-codex repo.

## Repo shape

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The contract — identity, scope, gates, threat model. Symlinked to `~/CLAUDE.md`. |
| `deploy/topics.tsv` | Remote-Control topic sessions (`key<TAB>Display Name`). |
| `deploy/claude-settings.json` | Curated, portable runtime settings (permissions, notifications). |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server structure with `${ENV}` placeholders — **no secrets**. Documentation of intent: it is only *read* if the session's cwd is this repo, or if it is passed explicitly with `--mcp-config`. See docs/context-budget.md. |
| `tools/` | This agent's tool notes. |
| `skills/` | This agent's skills, **folder-per-skill** (`<name>/SKILL.md`); fleet-common ones symlink `shared/skills/*`. See docs/skills.md in the claude-fleet-codex repo. |
| `memory/` | This agent's durable memory — two tiers: `distilled-memory.md` (hand-curated standing decisions) and machine-mirrored `auto/`. See docs/memory.md in the claude-fleet-codex repo. |
| `shared/` | Symlink → sibling clone `../kb-agent-shared` (global policies, decisions, runtime reference). |

## The `shared` symlink (sibling clone, not a submodule)

The shared governance layer is a **standalone sibling clone**, not a git submodule. Each brain reaches
it through a committed symlink:

```
shared -> ../kb-agent-shared
```

Clone both repos as siblings under `~/github/<ORG>/`, and a sync timer fast-forwards them (no submodule
commands). If `shared/` does not resolve, clone `<ORG>/kb-agent-shared` next to this repo. See
docs/config-model.md in the claude-fleet-codex repo for why sibling-clone
over submodule.

## How a root agent scaffolds a new brain

1. Copy this template to a new repo `<ORG>/kb-agent-<ROLE>-<AGENT>`.
2. Replace every placeholder in the table above across all files.
3. Confirm the committed `shared` symlink resolves to the sibling `../kb-agent-shared` clone.
4. `provision-agent` symlinks the root `CLAUDE.md` to `~/CLAUDE.md` and installs
   `deploy/claude-settings.json` into the runtime's settings location.
5. Provide real secrets **out of git** (an untracked env file the runtime reads for `${ENV}` values in
   `.mcp.json`).

## Secrets

Never commit secrets. `.gitignore` excludes env files and volatile runtime state; `.mcp.json` carries
only `${ENV}` placeholders resolved at runtime. Real credentials live on the box, out of git.
