# Shared Bootstrap Capsule

This repository (`kb-agent-shared`) is the **shared governance layer** for all of `<ORG>`'s agents:
global policies, ecosystem state, conventions, cross-agent decisions, and templates. Each agent has
its own repository (`kb-agent-<role>-<name>`) that reaches this repo through a `shared` symlink to a
**sibling clone** at `../kb-agent-shared` (not a git submodule — see the Claude Fleet Codex docs (`config-model.md`)).

Your own `CLAUDE.md` and what it imports are already loaded. Read from `shared/` only what the task
needs. Keep the initial context small.

## Human

`<OWNER>` is building `<ORG>` and wants pragmatic, owned, reviewable systems for AI-assisted
work. They prefer lean knowledge bases, direct language, concrete execution, skeptical analysis, and
one question at a time.

## Ecosystem State (current operating truth)

When older files disagree, prefer this section and the active policies/decisions it links to.

**Runtimes / interfaces**

- **Claude Code** on the VPS (Remote-Control sessions supervised by systemd user services — no tmux)
  is the primary/sole operational runtime and tool host. See the Claude Fleet Codex docs (`config-model.md`).
- An interactive reasoning/drafting cockpit can read/write selected GitHub and your business KB when authorized.
- Runtime memories (LLM runtime / vector stores) are caches/working memory, not canonical truth.

**Source of truth**

- Each agent's own `kb-agent-<role>-<name>` repo owns that agent's identity, memory, skills, and tools.
- `kb-agent-shared` (this repo) owns global policies, ecosystem state, conventions, cross-agent decisions, and templates.
- Your business KB (e.g. Notion) is canonical for business knowledge and operations — not agent brains.
- Object storage / a shared drive holds raw files/artifacts — not canonical memory.
- `<OWNER>` is the final authority for approvals, strategic direction, and policy changes.

**Agents**

Give each agent a short, memorable name and one of the shared archetypes:

- **cos-agent** — broad, unprivileged Chief of Staff / orchestration agent (`kb-agent-cos-<name>`).
- **root-agent** — narrow, privileged infrastructure/operations agent on `<VPS_HOST>`, runs with sudo (`kb-agent-ops-<name>`).
- **dev-agent** — dedicated build/dev agent for the website, small web apps, and automation
  engineering; self-contained token + deploy rights, never root (`kb-agent-dev-<name>`).
  See the Claude Fleet Codex docs (`multi-agent-governance.md`).
- Scaffold further agents from `kb-agent-template`.

**Deprecated / historical**

- Retired runtimes and superseded KB-sync layers stay recorded in `decisions/` but do not override this
  section unless explicitly reintroduced.
- Superseded work-management tooling: see the Claude Fleet Codex docs (`multi-agent-governance.md`). Your current work tracker
  (e.g. Jira/Linear) is the active choice.

## Bootstrap

Your bootstrap is your own `CLAUDE.md`, and that is the only copy of it. This file deliberately does
not restate the read order: a second copy is a copy that drifts, and this one had — it carried
repo-relative paths, which do not resolve from cwd=`~`, and a step 1 telling you to read `CLAUDE.md`,
which the harness loads before you read anything.

This file is for ecosystem state and the governance contract. Your `CLAUDE.md` points here; read it
when the task needs it. Use `shared/index.md` only when navigation is needed, and do not load whole
directories, all decisions, or archived documents at startup.

See `templates/agent-template.md` — "The one-place rule" — for what belongs always-on versus on demand.

## Safety

- Never save secrets, credentials, private keys, raw client data, or complete raw logs in any repo.
- Ask before external actions, infrastructure changes, irreversible changes, business commitments, or anything
  that could expose private information. Privileged agents follow their own additional human-confirm gates.

## Discovery Contract

A runtime should locate the shared layer through, in order: an explicit runtime/environment pointer to
`<ORG>/kb-agent-shared`; the agent repo's `shared` symlink to the sibling clone; a repository-root
`bootstrap.md`; or a root `index.md` pointing back to it.
