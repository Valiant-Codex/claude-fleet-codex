# Agent Template

New agents are scaffolded from the **`<ORG>/kb-agent-template`** repository and provisioned onto
a box with `infra/scripts/provision-agent` (which clones the brain + `kb-agent-shared` as a sibling and
wires the `shared/` symlink — no submodule commands). This document is the checklist for what a brain
should contain and how the pieces fit. For the *why* and boundary contract of a new agent, write a
decision in `decisions/` first (a dated `add-<agent>-<role>-agent.md` record is the worked example).

## Repo shape (`kb-agent-<role>-<name>`)

```
CLAUDE.md            ← THE contract: identity, scope, gates, threat model. Symlinked to
                       ~/CLAUDE.md. Loaded at launch with what it @-imports; the output style and
                       the skills' descriptions are the only other always-on inputs.
memory/              ← durable memory (distilled-memory.md + auto/); see policies/memory-policy.md
tools/               ← tool/MCP registry (README.md); secrets are ${ENV} placeholders, never committed
skills/              ← folder-per-skill (<name>/SKILL.md); fleet-common ones symlink shared/skills/*
deploy/              ← topics.tsv, claude-settings.json (runtime wiring)
.mcp.json            ← MCP servers with ${ENV} placeholders — no secrets. NOT read when the session
                       runs with cwd=~ unless passed via --mcp-config (see docs/context-budget.md)
shared -> ../kb-agent-shared   ← committed symlink to the sibling clone (global governance)
```

## Identity: one file, because one file is what loads

`CLAUDE.md` **is** the agent. It carries, in this order: who the agent is (identity, voice, principles),
its scope and delegation map, the untrusted-content prime directive, the human-confirm gates, the
autonomous-OK list, the threat model, and the safety invariants. `provision-agent` symlinks it to
`~/CLAUDE.md`, and the topic unit sets `WorkingDirectory=%h`, so this is the file the runtime loads.

**Use absolute `~/github/<org>/<brain>/…` paths.** Repo-relative paths do not resolve from cwd=`~`.

Who the owner and the org are lives once, fleet-wide, in `shared/owner-profile.md` — never duplicated
per agent.

### Why this is one file and not three (2026-08-07)

Until 2026-08-07 identity was split across `SOUL.md` (durable: who the agent is) and `OPERATING.md`
(mutable: what it does), with a thin `CLAUDE.md` pointing at both. The split was principled and the
principle was sound. It was also **not what happened at runtime.**

A fleet audit measured the loading path and found there is none: no `@`-import, no hook, no
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, no wrapper flag. `SOUL.md` and `OPERATING.md` entered context **only if the
model chose to obey an instruction telling it to read them.** On the reference deployment's own
transcripts, agents read their `OPERATING.md` in 22–54% of substantial sessions and their `SOUL.md` in
16–47%. Meanwhile 45–70% of each `OPERATING.md` was content that must bind *before* the agent knows to
look for it: the confirm gates, the threat model, the delegation map, the never-commit-secrets
invariant. **The brakes were out of context most of the time.** Every `SOUL.md` even asserted
`Loaded every session alongside OPERATING.md` in its own frontmatter, which was false.

The lesson generalizes past this framework: **a layer that loads only by instruction is not a layer,
it is a suggestion.** If a rule must hold, it belongs in the file the runtime reads by itself. Splitting
by *durability* (rarely-changed identity vs mutable contract) is a good instinct for authoring and a bad
one for loading — git already gives you the durability distinction, for free, without a second file.

Size is not the lever people assume. The runtime skips a `CLAUDE.md` only above **4 MiB** (memory docs,
re-read 2026-09-13); the vendor's guidance is "target under 200 lines per file", and `@`-imports count
in full because they expand at launch. A complete single-file contract runs 8–12 KB. There is no
always-on byte budget (retired in 0.8.10): the field evidence behind that release is that raw length
has no measurable effect and the number of competing instructions does. So the discipline is fewer,
unambiguous rules — not fewer bytes — and emphasis rationed to the lines whose breach is expensive: the
vendor's own rule is that if many lines are emphasised, none stands out.

### The one-place rule

A fact belongs in the always-loaded layer **only if the agent cannot know to go looking for it.**
Everything else is retrieved on demand, and is stated exactly once.

Always-on, therefore stated verbatim in `CLAUDE.md`: identity and voice (there is no trigger that makes
an agent fetch its own register — by the time it could, it has already spoken), the rules that must bind
*before* the agent knows a policy exists (untrusted-content; data residency and not-a-gestor where they
apply), the confirm gates and their autonomous-OK counterweight, and the delegation map, because an
agent cannot lazily retrieve the knowledge that a task belongs to someone else.

The output style is the second always-on file: voice and register live in
`deploy/output-styles/<agent>.md`, symlinked under `~/.claude/output-styles/` and loaded at launch
(0.8.6), so `CLAUDE.md` states neither.

Fleet-common always-on rules are the exception to "verbatim": they live once in
`shared/fleet-conduct.md` and every `CLAUDE.md` imports them with `@shared/fleet-conduct.md`
(imports expand at launch; tested through the `shared` symlink 2026-09-13, no approval dialog).
A rule goes there only if it holds for any model and any agent.

Retrieved on demand, therefore stated once in its own file and merely pointed at: everything else —
link lists, path mechanics, historical reasoning, deep procedure. Procedure specifically belongs in a
**skill**, which is the one retrievable layer the runtime advertises by itself.

This is a correctness rule, not a budget. Measured 2026-08-06 on harness 2.1.223: a fresh session loads
19.6k of 1.0M (2%), with MCP schemas deferred. There is nothing meaningful to reclaim, so do not trim
to save tokens. What a duplicated read order costs is not tokens but truth — three copies drift, each
one looks authoritative, and the fleet carried two standing bugs from exactly that: repo-relative paths
that do not resolve from cwd=`~`, and a step ordering a read of `CLAUDE.md`, which the harness has
already loaded before the agent reads anything.

## Skills

Folder-per-skill: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` + `description` frontmatter (the `description`
states *what* and *when*). `~/.claude/skills` is a whole-directory symlink to `skills/`, so new skills
are auto-discovered. Fleet-common skills live once in `kb-agent-shared/skills/` and are symlinked in
(`ln -s ../shared/skills/<name> skills/<name>`). See `policies/skills-policy.md` and the `skillify` skill.

## Cross-cutting rules

- **Boundaries:** keep each agent in its lane; name the agent that owns work outside scope. Cross-agent
  handoffs are relayed by <OWNER> in chat (the sending agent writes the brief as Markdown, <OWNER> pastes it
  into the receiving agent's session) — there is no handoff directory.
- **Access:** one agent = one Unix user + one GitHub bot account; least-privilege per
  `policies/github-access-policy.md` and the root agent's `manage-agents` skill (`references/github-access.md`).
- **Governance freshness:** `shared/` stays current via kb-sync (no submodule commands). Runtime and
  portability: the root agent's `manage-agents` skill (`references/agent-ops-and-portability.md`).
