# Knowledge Governance Workflow — OKF Hygiene

## Purpose

Keep every agent brain small, current, and OKF-conformant. This is the *document-format* half of
KB governance — the frontmatter shape and the checks that catch drift before it's committed. The
*decision-making* half (identify a candidate, classify its target, decide whether it's durable,
promote or discard) is `shared/policies/memory-policy.md`'s Promotion Workflow — don't duplicate
it here; read that policy for "where does this fact go."

## OKF Adherence

Every Markdown document in an agent repo adheres to the [Open Knowledge Format v0.1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md).

## OKF Frontmatter Standard

**This section is the only copy of the frontmatter contract. Do not restate it anywhere** — not in a
`README.md`, not in `templates/`. The reference implementation shipped three copies for a while, and
the two that no tooling asserted both drifted back to a stale required set with no closed
vocabulary, while sitting in exactly the two files a new document gets scaffolded against. If you
need the contract somewhere else, link to this file.

Every Markdown document must include a parseable YAML frontmatter block with at minimum:

**Required (OKF spec §4.1):**
- `type` — concept kind, lowercase, **from the closed vocabulary below**. Put any finer distinction in
  `tags`, never in `type`.

### The `type` vocabulary (closed — do not invent values)

| `type` | Use for |
|---|---|
| `skill` | anything at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Always this, no exceptions. |
| `decision` | a decision record in `decisions/`. |
| `policy` | a fleet rule in `policies/`. |
| `memory` | any memory document, including `distilled-memory.md`. |
| `tool-registry` | a tool/MCP note in `tools/`. |
| `template` | a blank skeleton in `templates/`. |
| `reference` | stable background material (`owner-profile.md`, context docs) **and a skill's own `references/*.md`** — only the `SKILL.md` itself is `skill`. |
| `directory-readme` | the README that indexes a directory. Every one of them. |
| `working-doc` | scratch reasoning in `staging/`, until it closes and becomes a decision. |

Nine values, consolidated 2026-08-07 from **21** observed. **The drift checker asserts this list** — a
vocabulary nothing checks is a preference, and this one spent its first day declared-but-unapplied
across 36 files. `runbook` was retired in the same pass: the
directory it named is gone, because only skills are discovered by the runtime — a procedure filed
anywhere else is reachable only by luck. The fleet had reached seven different types for the
one artefact "README of a folder" (`directory-readme`, `directory-index`, `repository-index`,
`bundle-index`, `memory-registry`, `skill-registry`, `tool-registry`), a 16/12 split between `decision`
and `decision-record` with no rule distinguishing them, and `distilled-memory` in three repos against
`memory` in a fourth. A vocabulary that grows one value per document is not a vocabulary.

### Three deliberate exemptions

These are **not** OKF documents and must not carry frontmatter:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — a runtime artefact, injected verbatim into the model's context. YAML at the top
   would be noise in the always-on context, not metadata for a reader.
2. **`memory/auto/**`** — machine-owned. `memory-mirror` copies these byte-for-byte from the runtime's
   own store, so they carry *its* schema (`name`, `description`, `metadata.node_type`). Adding OKF fields
   by hand is not merely pointless, it is **undone by the next nightly run**. Byte-identity is the
   feature: it is what makes restoring the tier a copy rather than a migration. Do not "fix" these files,
   and do not count them as violations.
3. **`deploy/output-styles/*.md`** (added 2026-08-25) — a runtime artefact, symlinked into
   `~/.claude/output-styles/` and parsed directly by Claude Code's own frontmatter schema (`name`,
   `description`, `keep-coding-instructions`). Same reasoning as `CLAUDE.md`: an OKF `type` field would
   be an unrecognized key in a schema this repo does not own, in a file live in production the moment
   it is written. `agentic-divergence-check` skips the whole `output-styles/` directory, the same way
   it skips `auto/`.

Before 2026-08-07 these two exemptions were unwritten, so 31% of the fleet's Markdown "violated" a rule
that was never intended to reach it. Excluding them, conformance is near-total.

**Recommended (OKF spec §4.1):**
- `title` — human-readable display name.
- `description` — one-line summary.
- `tags` — YAML list of short strings.
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 datetime of last meaningful change.
- `resource` — canonical URI, when the document describes a specific system/tool/resource (omit
  for abstract concepts).

**Producer extensions (permitted by OKF spec §4.1):**
- `status` — `active`, `draft`, `superseded`, or `archived`.

## Core Rules

- Prefer one clear document over several overlapping ones.
- Update an existing file before creating a sibling that says almost the same thing.
- Rewrite or archive stale content quickly rather than letting it sit contradicted.
- Keep only durable knowledge that improves future execution.
- Avoid unnecessary metadata churn (don't bump `timestamp` for non-meaningful edits).

## Validation

Before committing a KB change, verify that:

- frontmatter is valid YAML;
- `type` is present, non-empty, and correct for the file's location — `skill` for any `SKILL.md`,
  per `skills-policy.md`. **Scoped to the file, not the folder:** a skill's own `references/*.md`
  are `reference`, not `skill`. This line used to say "`skill` under any `skills/` folder", which
  contradicted the vocabulary table above ("anything at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`") and made every
  conformance judgement ambiguous in the one direction that matters — progressive disclosure exists
  precisely to put the bulk of a skill in sibling files;
- `type` is drawn from the closed vocabulary above. `agentic-divergence-check` asserts this, and
  only this — it does **not** check `type` against location, so the two rules in this section have
  different teeth: the vocabulary fails a run, the location rule is honour-system;
- `timestamp` is ISO 8601;
- local links resolve;
- no secrets or raw sensitive data are included;
- the diff reduces drift rather than adding noise (fewer/clearer documents, not more).

## Post-Write Verification

For writes that land in a remote repo, don't report completion until the remote source of truth
has been verified after the write. Acceptable verification: checking the pushed commit on the
remote branch, reading the changed file through GitHub, or the GitHub Contents API or equivalent.
Include the verified commit or artifact path in the final report when practical. This specializes
`approval-policy.md`'s general commit-and-push rule for the KB-document case — that policy is the
canonical statement of "commit and push are one atomic unit," not repeated here.

  (applies to any repo change, not just KB documents) that this section specializes.
- `shared/policies/memory-policy.md` — the Promotion Workflow (deciding *whether* and *where*
  something becomes durable knowledge); this skill only governs the document's shape once that
  decision is made.
- `shared/policies/skills-policy.md` — why `type: skill` is fixed for a `SKILL.md` (the file, not
  everything under `skills/` — see Validation).
- `agent-audit` — the human-gated periodic sweep that curates memory/skills using these same
  hygiene rules.
