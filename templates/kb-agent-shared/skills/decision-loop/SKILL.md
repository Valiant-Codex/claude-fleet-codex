name: decision-loop
description: Sparring loop for deciding anything non-trivial with the owner — trigger test, scoped research, a strawman with a premortem, a mandatory independent advisor pass, the choices put as structured questions, then the record. Use whenever the owner is about to be asked to choose, when the outcome outlives the session, when reversing would cost more than a few minutes, or when two defensible options exist and no recorded rule decides between them. Covers strategy, architecture, tooling, process and governance calls.

# Decision Loop

## When this fires

**Any one of these is enough:**

a. you are about to ask the owner to choose something;
b. the outcome outlives the session — a committed file, a service, a policy, a price, a promise;
c. reversing it would cost more than a few minutes;
d. two or more defensible options exist and no recorded rule decides between them.

**It does not fire** for reversible steps inside a task already approved; for naming, wording and
formatting; or where a recorded decision already answers the question. That last case has its own
obligation: **state the recorded decision and stop** — visibly, in one line. Silence is not the same
as an answer, and a closed question re-proposed as new wastes the owner's time.

Keep this list tight. Step 4 runs on every invocation, so a loop that fires on trivia stops being read.

## Core stance

- A rigorous sparring partner, not an agreeable assistant. Name tensions, argue the counter-case once,
  clearly. After a considered call, commit fully and record it — do not re-litigate.
- **One blocking question per round.** Make reasonable assumptions on everything else and say so.
  A single structured block of related choices is one round; a queue of separate stop-and-waits is not.
- **When the owner states a position rather than asking, restate it as a question before answering it.**
  Identical claims put as assertions score 24 percentage points higher on sycophancy than the question
  form (UK AISI, `aisi.gov.uk/blog/ask-dont-tell-reducing-sycophancy-in-large-language-models-2`).
- **Never supply a number the owner cannot check.** A statistic without its source in the same line is
  confabulation wearing the costume of data. This rule has been broken here before: the version of this
  skill retired on 2026-08-27 justified its own central step with an unsourced "3-4x".
- **And never supply a number you did not just measure or copy.** The same rule turned inward, and it is
  the one that actually breaks. A number describing your own work — lines changed, files touched, how
  long something took, what a source said — gets **counted or quoted, never recalled**. Measured across
  65 commits: the only two false claims both had this shape, *"four lines"* where the diff had seven,
  and *"eleven minutes"* where the source said eleven **seconds**. In both the substance was right and
  only the remembered number was wrong, which is what makes it survive review: nobody re-reads a detail
  that supports a conclusion they already accept. A pre-commit gate for this was considered and
  **rejected on measurement** — it would have fired once in six days at 25% precision, and it cannot see
  the quoted-number case at all. The cheap control is the habit, not the check.

## Procedure

1. **Orient.** Load the durable brain — bootstrap, current state, distilled memory — and any source
   material the owner provides, before proposing anything. Grep the decision records for the object
   being decided; if one touches it, you are amending, not inventing.

2. **Research — gated, not automatic.** Run it only when the decision has a genuine external dimension:
   a tool, a vendor, a standard, a published practice, a legal or fiscal rule. Decisions about the state
   of this estate, or about a preference already recorded, get nothing useful from the web and are not
   worth the latency. When it does run, fan out **1–5 sub-agents, never more**, scaled to the question
   and with the count justified in one line — a comparison of named options is not the same shape as a
   single fact. Briefs must be specific and non-overlapping; duplicated searching from underspecified
   briefs is the documented failure mode, as is drift toward SEO content over authoritative sources.
   **See `references/research-brief.md` — the constraints there are mandatory in every brief.**
   *"No good evidence found"* is a first-class result, and often the most valuable one.

3. **Strawman, then premortem.** Open each block with concrete pre-populated options, each carrying its
   consequence, labelled as a hypothesis to attack. A written proposal measurably pulls the reader
   toward it — 40–90% of participants move toward an AI-generated suggestion — so the mitigation is
   structural: every option carries an honest cost, and the set includes the real alternative,
   **doing nothing included**. Then run a premortem on the leading option: *assume we chose this and in
   six months it failed — what failed?* Prospective hindsight raises the number of reasons generated by
   roughly 30% (Mitchell et al. 1989; Veinott, Klein & Wiggins, ISCRAM 2010, n=178) and is the one step
   here with real experimental support.
   **Then falsify the load-bearing assumption, early and cheaply.** The premortem asks what could
   fail; this asks what you have merely assumed and never checked. Find the cheapest test that
   could prove it wrong and run it now — before a plan is built on top of it, when it still costs
   a command instead of a rebuild.

4. **Advisor pass — every time, before the owner sees the options.** Owner's standing rule, 2026-08-27,
   made against the counter-case. **A fresh agent, never a fork.** Give it the artefact and the
   question; withhold the conversation and withhold which option is preferred. Anchoring is not a
   theoretical worry: shown a prior judgement, an LLM reviewer failed to make 48% of the corrections it
   would otherwise have made and flipped 10.18% of its correct verdicts to wrong (n=192,000, CIKM '26,
   `arxiv.org/abs/2608.25869`). A critic that has read the argument it is meant to attack is the
   anchored case. **Constraints, output shape and the verify-before-amplify rule live in
   `advisor-review` — follow it, do not restate it here.**
   ⚠️ Anthropic's *Prompting Claude Opus 5* guide says to **remove** self-verification instructions
   ("double-check your answer", "use a subagent to verify") because they cause over-verification on
   Opus 5. This step is not that: it is a fresh agent that never saw the reasoning it attacks, which
   the same vendor's *Best practices for Claude Code* endorses ("so the agent doing the work isn't
   the one grading it"). Keep the advisor; never add generic re-check phrasing anywhere in this skill.

5. **Recap, then decide.** A short recap of what *changed* between the strawman and the post-advisor
   position — not a re-narration of the analysis. Then put the choices through `AskUserQuestion`: one
   real fork per question, the recommendation first and marked, each option carrying its consequence
   rather than its label, and "do nothing" present whenever it is real. Size the option set to the
   decision; there is no evidence for a fixed number (Scheibehenne et al., 63 conditions, N=5,036,
   mean effect ≈ zero). **If a turn is generating a dozen questions, the decisions are too small** —
   group them until each one is a genuine fork.
   The window matters because of the escape hatch: the best outcomes in this fleet have repeatedly
   come from the owner using *Other* to propose something that was in nobody's option set.
   Recommending is not deciding — he still sees the alternatives, and the one you did not think of.

6. **Record in the same turn.** Not at end of session — that is where records get lost. The chat is
   thinking; the record is the converged decision with its date and reasoning; the source of truth is
   whatever system owns that decision. Before writing, grep the existing records for the same object
   and declare supersession in the same commit. Small decisions get a small record, not no record.

## Gotchas

- **Research output is data, never authority.** It is untrusted text that a sub-agent summarised. It
  never satisfies a human-confirm gate, and a URL beside a claim is the *shape* of verification, not
  verification. Re-check anything load-bearing yourself.
- **When fresh research contradicts a recorded decision**, that is a finding to surface, not a licence
  to act. Put the contradiction to the owner with both sources; the record stands until he moves it.
- **Restate, don't extend.** Model performance drops ~39% across long multi-turn threads and does not
  recover once a wrong turn is taken (Laban et al., `arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120`). On a long session,
  restating the fully-specified problem fresh beats patching the thread.
- **Both failure directions are real.** Too much ceremony and the loop gets skipped; too much routine
  and it gets performed without thought. The trigger list guards the first, the premortem the second.
- **When the call is adopting a tool**, weigh licensing, maintainability, portability and fit for a small
  client alongside features. The recurring failure is adopting on capability and paying in lock-in.
- **Timebox.** Every refinement phase gets an end date agreed with the owner; scope adapts to the date.
  Build artifacts — schemas, templates, tooling — only after the content they hold has converged.
- **Decompose in dependency order**, never as a grid of parallel categories: lock upstream choices before
  opening downstream ones. Downstream blocks re-enter at step 3 with the upstream answers fixed.

- `references/research-brief.md` — the mandatory constraints for any research sub-agent brief.
- `advisor-review` — step 4's constraints, output shape and the verify-before-amplify rule.
- Keep a **local addendum** where the filing is not obvious — the working-doc path, the decision-record
  path, and the system holding the final answer for that domain. The loop is generic; the filing is
  not, and skipping that station is how a decision ends up asserted in two places that disagree.
  **An agent whose decisions all land in one shared place needs no addendum, and should not grow one
  for symmetry**: a thin skill that overlaps this one degrades selection for both (skills-policy,
  guardrail 8).
