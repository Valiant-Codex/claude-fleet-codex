# Skillify

The executable companion to `shared/policies/skills-policy.md`: how to write, update, and retire a
skill so the fleet's skills stay discoverable, lean, and low-drift. This is a **fleet-common** skill —
it lives once in `shared/skills/skillify/` and is symlinked into each agent's `skills/`.

## When to use

- You've performed a procedure two or three times and it's worth codifying.
- An existing skill is out of date, or its steps changed.
- You're adding a new capability, or retiring an obsolete one.
- <OWNER> asks for a skill to be made, or for one to change.

Do **not** pre-write speculative skills for things that haven't happened. One skill = one procedure you
actually perform.

## Format (v2 — Anthropic Agent Skills)

A skill is a **folder** `skills/<name>/` whose entry point is `SKILL.md`:

```
skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md          # frontmatter + body (<5k tokens)
├── references/       # optional: deep detail, loaded only when the body points to it
└── scripts/          # optional: executable helpers; only their OUTPUT enters context
```

Frontmatter merges harness fields with OKF:

```yaml
name: <lowercase-hyphens, <=64 chars, must not contain "claude" or "anthropic">
description: <what it does AND when to use it — <=1024 chars; the harness matches on this>
type: skill
title: <Human Title>
tags: [ ... ]
status: active            # active | draft | superseded | archived
timestamp: <ISO-8601>
```

- **Body under ~5k tokens.** Sequence the job and capture the gotchas; push deep detail into
  `references/` and long/deterministic steps into `scripts/`. Point to this skill's own `references/*` instead of
  duplicating them.
- **`description` is the most important field** — make it trigger-rich: state both *what* it does and
  *when* to reach for it.

## Naming taxonomy

- **capability** (action-based): `dokploy-service-mgmt`, `notion-authoring`
- **behavioral** (layered method): `<domain>-<method>`
- **outcome / domain**: `agent-audit`, `patch-management`

## Registration (automatic)

`~/.claude/skills` is a whole-directory symlink to your repo's `skills/`, so any new
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is discovered with zero setup. **Fleet-common skills** live once in
`shared/skills/<name>/` and are symlinked into each agent's tree:
`ln -s ../shared/skills/<name> skills/<name>`.

## Procedure

First decide the mode. Look for `skills/<name>/` in your own repo **and** in `shared/skills/`, under the
name you have in mind and under any name that covers the same job. A second skill for an intent that
already has one is the shadowing `skills-policy.md` guardrail 8 warns about.

- **Not found → create.** Interview when it is mandatory (below) and get the summary approved;
  otherwise answer its seven topics in the commit body. Then: pick a name (taxonomy
  above) → `mkdir skills/<name>` → write `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + lean body) → add
  `references/`/`scripts/` only if genuinely needed → validate (below) → commit → push → give <OWNER>
  the commit link.
- **Found → update.** Read the `SKILL.md` and its history before asking anything. For a shared skill
  run `git log -p -- skills/<name>` inside `kb-agent-shared`: in your own repo that path is a symlink
  and shows only the commit that added it. Interview on what works and what does not (same rule as
  create), then edit in place, validate, commit, push and give the link. If behavior changed
  materially, say so in the commit. Only the privileged agent writes `shared/skills/`; any other agent
  hands the approved summary to it through <OWNER>.
- The commit **is** the review gate; <OWNER> can veto or roll back via git history. The approved
  summary comes before the diff review; it does not replace it.
- **Retire:** mark `status: superseded` with a top banner pointing to the replacement (keep it in place
  while anything still references it), or **delete it** — git holds the body and the reasoning. Do not
  park it in a parallel `skills-archive/` tree: it becomes a second place to keep current, and the
  reference deployment's archive grew six live references to a skill its own registry still called active.

## Interview — find out what <OWNER> wants before writing

A skill built from the data alone encodes your guesses about their workflow. The interview replaces
the guesses with their answers.

**When it is mandatory:** the skill serves a workflow of <OWNER>'s **and** <OWNER> is in the session.
If it serves their workflow and they are not in the session, do not write it: wait until they are. An
internal technical skill you write alone keeps the path above, but its commit body answers the same
seven topics in writing — "not asked" is an allowed answer — so the gap is visible in review.

**The seven topics** (in update mode, ask about each as "what works, what does not"):

1. **Goals** — what the skill is for, what problem it removes.
2. **Steps** — the sequence as they see it, not as the data suggests.
3. **Don'ts** — what it must never do.
4. **Input and real examples** — how they will invoke it, with 2–3 phrases they would actually type.
   Keep them verbatim: they are the test prompts for Validation step 1.
5. **Output and "done"** — what they expect at the end, and how they tell it went well.
6. **Boundaries and autonomy** — what it may do alone, where it must stop and ask, what it must never
   touch.
7. **Edge cases** — what happens when data is missing or ambiguous.

**Pace.** Blocks of 2–4 questions with `AskUserQuestion`, until the seven are covered. Read what exists
first (the data, the old skill, its log) so each option is a real candidate, and leave free text open
for the answers you could not foresee. Topic 4 has no options to offer: ask for their phrases in plain
text, outside the menu.

- Do not mark a "(Recommended)" option where the answer lives only in their head. Mark one only where
  you have analysed the options, and show the analysis.
- Never put a question inside a procedural prompt ("another block?"): that is how a cap gets breached.
- At the end of a block, name any answers that contradict each other and ask them to resolve them. Do
  not resolve them yourself.

**The summary.** When the topics are covered, write the skill in plain language, in a few short
paragraphs: what it does, the steps, what it never does, when it stops and asks, what "done" looks
like. List anything never asked as an assumption. <OWNER> approves it, or corrects it, **before any
file is written**. Their approval is what ends the interview; you do not end it on your own.

## Guardrails

- **Git is the control plane.** Every change is a diffable, revertible commit — nothing self-modifies
  invisibly. This is what keeps self-authored skills from drifting into an unreviewable mess.
- **Write real, not speculative.**
- **Scope correctly.** Your own repo for agent-specific skills; `shared/skills/` only for genuinely
  fleet-common ones; privileged/cross-agent procedures belong to the agent that owns them.
- **Lean, not sprawling.** Push depth into `references/`; prune and mark superseded; don't accrete.

## Validation

Two levels. The first checks the shape; the second checks whether the skill is worth its place.

**Shape — every time:**

- `name` + `description` present; `name` equals the folder name; lowercase-hyphens, <=64 chars, no
  reserved words.
- Body under ~5k tokens; deep detail lives in `references/`.
- After the skills dir changes, the skill appears in the harness skill list (whole-dir symlink). If it
  doesn't, check the folder name and the frontmatter.

**Effectiveness — for every new skill, and at every review:**

`skills-policy.md` says the review question is "would this still earn its place against a no-skill
baseline". This is how you answer it instead of guessing.

1. Write 2–3 realistic test prompts — what <OWNER> would actually type, not a paraphrase of your own
   `description`. A prompt written from the description tests the description, not the skill. When
   an interview ran, use the phrases they gave for topic 4, verbatim.
2. For each prompt, spawn **two** sub-agents **in the same turn**: one given the skill's path, one
   given no skill at all. Same prompt, same inputs. Write outputs under the session scratchpad,
   `<scratchpad>/skill-eval/<name>/<prompt-id>/{with,without}/`. Launch them together — staggering
   them invites you to read the first result and pre-judge the second.
3. Compare, and name the outcome. **The skill wins** — keep it. **A tie** — the model already knew,
   or the skill is too generic to add anything; either way it is a candidate for deletion, not for
   more prose. **The skill loses** — almost always because it steers wrong, not because it is missing
   a section; cut the steer rather than adding a caveat.
4. **Triggering is a separate test from quality.** A good skill that never fires is worth nothing.
   Take a prompt that *should* reach for it and check whether it does, without naming the skill. If
   it doesn't fire, the defect is in the `description`, not the body — that is the field the harness
   matches on.

The rule underneath all of it: **a run with the skill proves nothing without the run without it.**
A plausible-looking output is not evidence the skill caused it.

When updating an existing skill, the baseline is the *old version*, not no-skill: snapshot it before
editing and point the second sub-agent at the snapshot.

- The with/without evaluation above is borrowed from Anthropic's official `skill-creator` plugin,
  **deliberately absorbed rather than installed** (2026-08-27). Installing it would have put
  third-party instructions beside ours in a root-privileged session, and left two skills competing on
  the same intent — the shadowing `skills-policy.md` guardrail 8 warns about. Do not re-propose
  installing it; take further ideas from it by hand, the same way.
